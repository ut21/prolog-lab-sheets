mark(p):
	p = marked	
HORN_SAT(phi):
	phi = phi_1 and phi_2 and ... phi_k, where phi_i is horn clause
	for p in phi:
		mark(p) if p==True
	while (p1 and p2 and... pk --> q of phi such that all p_j are marked but q is not marked)
	do {mark(q)}
	if False is marked:
		return not satisfiable
	return satisfiable

this is linear time. Note: DNF_SAT was polynomial time, and CNF_SAT is NP complete, while CNF_validity is polynomial
